# Classical Music MIDI dataset 
# LSTM Model & Voting Classification
# In order to run the code, you need to upload the file midi_files_21 to your google drive
# Ended up with ~70% sequence identification accuracy and about 100% MIDI file accuracy (likely not perfect but hard to determine due to data limitations)

# midi_files_21 contains the MIDI data for this project! I would rename it but the uploaded code calls for that specific name
